# basic usage of linux command

linux change default terminal folder:
    `vi .bashrc`, add `cd <your folder name>` to the last line and reopen terminal

temporary leave vim edit mode: **ctrl + z**, go back by command `fg`

alias command:
    `cd` to homefolder, then `vi .bashrc`, add `alias md=mkdir` to the last line. Then `source .bashrc`.**Note: there is no space between two sides of =**
    > in zsh, it's the same, replace `.bashrc` with `.zshrc`

run `.sh` file:
    `sh xxxx.sh`
